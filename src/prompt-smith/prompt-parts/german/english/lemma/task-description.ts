export const taskDescription = `Classify the given German surface form and determine its lemma (dictionary form).

You receive:
- surface: a German word as it appears in text (may be inflected, compound, or a variant)
- context: the sentence where the word was encountered

Return:
- linguisticUnit: "Lexem" (single word), "Phrasem" (multi-word expression), or "Morphem" (bound morpheme)
- pos: part of speech (only for Lexem). One of: Noun, Pronoun, Article, Adjective, Verb, Preposition, Adverb, Particle, Conjunction, InteractionalUnit
- surfaceKind: "Lemma" (already dictionary form), "Inflected" (conjugated/declined), or "Variant" (spelling variant)
- lemma: the dictionary/citation form of the word

Rules:
- For nouns: lemma is nominative singular (e.g., "Häuser" → "Haus")
- For verbs: lemma is infinitive (e.g., "ging" → "gehen")
- For adjectives: lemma is base form without endings (e.g., "schönes" → "schön")
- For separable verbs: include prefix in lemma (e.g., "fing...an" → "anfangen")
- Phrasem: multi-word fixed expression (e.g., "auf jeden Fall" → lemma: "auf jeden Fall")
- If the surface IS the lemma, surfaceKind is "Lemma"
- pos is omitted for Phrasem and Morphem`;
