  "description": "Create a standalone Bun script (scripts/knowledge-silo.ts) that analyzes git history to detect knowledge silos — modules where only one contributor has meaningful ownership. The script parses git log --numstat output to compute per-file authorship, aggregates by module directory, calculates bus factor per module, and flags silos where a single author dominates with no recent contributions from others. Output is a Markdown report to stdout. A package.json script entry 'silo' is added for convenience.",

  "steps": [
    "Record current branch (nightshift) and create new branch nightshift-knowledge-silo from nightshift",
    "Create scripts/knowledge-silo.ts — a standalone Bun script that analyzes git log --numstat to compute per-file and per-directory authorship metrics (lines added/deleted per author, commit count, recency)",
    "Implement module-level aggregation: group files by top-level src/ directories (commanders/librarian, commanders/textfresser, managers/*, stateless-helpers/*, etc.) and compute bus factor (number of contributors who account for >50% of changes) per module",
    "Implement silo detection heuristics: flag modules where a single author owns >80% of commits AND no other author has touched the module in the last 90 days",
    "Implement report output: generate a Markdown report (printed to stdout) with sections for (a) per-module bus factor table, (b) identified knowledge silos with risk level, (c) recommended cross-training areas",
    "Add 'silo' script to package.json scripts: \"silo\": \"bun scripts/knowledge-silo.ts\"",
    "Run the script against the current repo to validate output",
    "Commit changes with Nightshift-Task trailer and create PR to master"
